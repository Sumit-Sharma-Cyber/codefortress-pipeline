🛠 Features We'll Implement in Code
✅ Wake Word Activation – Neuro will activate only when you say "Neuro".
✅ Self-Introduction – If you ask "Who are you?", it will respond:
🗣️ "Hi, I am Neuro, made by Mr. Sumit Sharma. I am built with an ESP32, motors, sensors, and a voice assistant system."
✅ Voice-Controlled Searching – If you ask something (e.g., "What is AI?"), it will search the internet and respond.
✅ Conversational AI – It will reply like ChatGPT (e.g., "How can I help you?").
✅ Emotional Responses – It will have friendly, excited, and thinking tones.
✅ Male Voice Output – Neuro will use Google Text-to-Speech (TTS) API for a male voice output.
✅ Movement Control – If you say "Move forward" or "Turn left", it will respond & move accordingly.

🛠 Steps to Implement
1️⃣ Hardware Setup
ESP32 (Brain of Neuro)

Microphone Module (Detects voice)

Speaker Module (DFPlayer Mini or Android TTS via Bluetooth) (Plays voice output)

HC-05 Bluetooth Module (If using phone for internet search)

L298N Motor Driver (For movement)

BO Motors + Servo Motor (For movement & nodding)

2️⃣ Software & Libraries
speech_recognition → Listens for commands

pyttsx3 → Converts text to male voice

gTTS → (Alternative) Uses Google’s text-to-speech

requests → Searches the internet

Bluetooth Serial → Connects ESP32 with Android phone

Arduino C + Python → ESP32 & AI Assistant Code
